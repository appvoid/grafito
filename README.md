This is a public research experiment and personal project on a of prompt-fine-tuned GPT-J model for generation tasks on chat form. Each one of these iterations are in current evaluation (prompt-engineering) to explore better ways to extract useful conversational tasks from them. Custom prompts and an Android app is on the way. Link will be available through this file in the future. "Grafito" comes from Spanish word and it means Graphite. It's powered by the glorious banana's API!
