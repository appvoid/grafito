This is a public research experiment and personal project on a of prompt-fine-tuned GPT-J model for generation tasks on chat form. Each one of these iterations are in current evaluation (prompt-engineering) to explore better ways to extract useful conversational tasks from them. Custom prompts and an Android app is on the way. Link will be available through this file in the future. "Grafito" comes from Spanish word and it means Graphite. It's powered by the glorious banana's API!

Note that finetuned-codename-version and codename-version are used interchangebly here and that the current models, names and/or techniques are prone to change over time.

The techniques used are One-Shot and Few-Shot learning. Future iterations will adopt a mixture of Few-Shot and MultiModal Intent Classification.
